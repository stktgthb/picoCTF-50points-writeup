# Glory of the Garden

## Description

This [garden](https://github.com/stktgthb/picoCTF-50points-writeup/blob/main/picoCTF_50points_writeup/Forensics/garden.jpg) contains more than it seems.(The garden picture is available on picoCTF.)

## Solution

We need to upload the image file into the binary editor and check if it has flag. I used an online binary editor called [hexed.it](https://hexed.it/).

## Flag
